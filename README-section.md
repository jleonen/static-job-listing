## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

Working on this project has allowed me to work a lot with Flexbox and CSS Grid to format the website according to the design. It has also allowed me to practice using Javascript, especially with DOM manipulation and working with some new methods, such as Object.entries, forEach method, filter method, insertAdjacentHTML method and many more. I believe this project was a great challenge for me to improve my CSS skills as well as my Javascript skills.

### Continued development

I believe that I could use more practice with DOM manipulation and using it to render data with the InsertAdjacentHTML method. I could also use more practice with some array methods. In the future, I would like to start practicing on using the map function for example and using the spread operator more. Also, when I am formatting the HTML variable, you will notice that I had placed an onClick attribute on each tag in the HTML. I was not sure how to refactor this at the time but in the future, I will try to figure out how to apply the tagHunt function without having to attach the onClick attribute on every tag while maintaining the logic of the function itself.
